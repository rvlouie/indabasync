            <p>Here at Indaba we are always working to find and create new opportunities for musicians. As part of that ongoing mission we have created a boutique licensing catalog of the best music from emerging artists that we work with. </p><p>We pitch this catalog to music supervisors and industry professionals for sync placement in film television, and internet media. Since the launch of the catalog a couple of years ago, we’ve made placements with clients such as Microsoft, Converse, United Airlines, Hollister, Quicksilver, Forever 21, JanSport, Fox Head, Sonos, OnStar, and Current TV, and have generated more than $150,000 in revenue for musicians.</p><p>We think that your music has what it takes to be a part of Indaba Sync. Continue reading to learn about our terms and what they mean for you. If you decide you’d like to be a part of Indaba Sync, please <a href="#terms">review and e-sign the agreement</a> at the bottom of this document.</p><p>Check out our most recent placements <a href="http://www.indabasync.com/placements/">here</a></p>

    		<h1>Rights and Term</h1>
    		<ul>
          <li>You keep 100% of the rights to your music. This agreement gives us the right to license the song and collect on your behalf, but we hold no claims to any rights on your music.</li>
          <li>This is a NON-EXCLUSIVE agreement. Inclusion in our catalogue does not inhibit the use of your song in anyway. You can still sell and license your song independently or through other vendors.</li>
          <li>The term is for as long as you choose. This agreement has no set term, but instead allows you to opt out at anytime simply by e-mailing us.</li>
          <li>Any money made from placements generated by Indaba will be split 50/50 between you and Indaba. </li>
